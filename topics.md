## Accepted Topics
* **Session Title**: Do More with Less JavaScript: Minimal MEAN
 * **Event Type**: 50-min Lecture
 * **Summary**: JavaScript moves at the light of speed. Moving that fast may burn you, hard! Focusing on minimal tooling, and fewer frameworks will allow you to become an expert by going deeper, rather than stretching yourself too thin while achieving better results. I'll talk about why Angular 2, npm and TypeScript are the right technologies to focus on in 2017.

* **Session Title**: In Action: Contributing to Open Source Software 
 * **Event Type**: Lecture / Demo
 * **Summary**: I queue up some pull requests that I know I can tackle (.NET) and go through the process of submitting pull requests via Github. NOTE: This is experimental and a little risky. I would do prep work ahead of time and see if I can reserve some PRs for this purpose (coordinating with OSS authors, etc.)

* **Session Title**: DevOps: Level Up Your Career
 * **Event Type**: 50-min Lecture
 * **Summary**: DevOps is a killer buzzword these days... So what is it, exactly?  Is this just putting developers in the on-call rotation? Is this making Ops people join our standups?  Is this just running scripts to provision machines on AWS? There is a real phenomenon here, and it's worth understanding.  Chances are, DevOps is going to affect your career whether you embrace it now, or get dragged along by the rising tide.  The truth is, DevOps has its roots in a paper going back to 1970, and has been fully enabled thanks to the convergence of agile software development, automation, and hardware virtualization.  There are many historical perspectives; this one is mine.  Let me inspire your upcoming career choices.

 * **Event Type**: 50-min Lecture
 * **Summary**:  With so many tools and technologies in the forefront of modern web development, it's hard to know where to focus your time.  The three top contenders, according to many sources, are Angular 2, React, and Vue.  So which one should you spend your time on?  This talk will give you an overview of the setup cost, features, and development experience you can expect with each one, as well as giving a brief demo of each.  You will walk away with enough information to make an informed decision for yourself.
